Code Samples for UB

Hello.

Included are a few code samples for your review. 

I'd start with prescriptions.cs and audit.cs, the language I code with often, C#. Prescriptions was a project I was put on
when we moved our school out of Visual Foxpro and onto the web. The audit page is a simple search page for our Director of Asset
Management to use (to view who made what changes in our database).

I've also included examples of T-SQL, including a stored procedure that handles our CRUD operations, a Delete Trigger example,
and an aggregate string example.

Also included is an outdated language that we are transitioning out of, Foxpro. The code is in updnew_auth.prg, which is a program
that populates tables we use for our employees to have the ability to fill out their timesheets. They must be shipped out to the
proper building/domain location (we have 3 domain controllers) and then into a temp\authoriz table before they can put in their time
for the week.

Hope this is helpful.

Best Regards,
William Zdon
